# UFOs
## Overview
### A summary of UFOs

##### I was tasked with creating a webpage that could search through data for various reported extraterrestrial sightings.  The page needed to be able to search through the data from five different criteria while also having several paragraphs and photos.

### A Dynamic Tables Creation

##### I used five criteria for searching through the data:
* Date of sighting.
* City near the sighting.
* State sighting occurred in.
* Country sighting occurred in.
* The shape the UFO was described as. 
* Below you will see the search bars and the result columns from the webpage.

## UFOs Summary
### Creating Credibility:

##### With the webpage search function, one drawback might be that there should be no need to search by City, State, and Country.  One thing we could do to improve the page might be to have another data set of flight plans, satellite orbits, star movements, and other possible explanations for the UFOs available to help weed out any sightings that are easily explainable. This will give the page more credibility and will make it seem less like we are just trying to get anything seen in the sky as a UFO. Another thing that we could do is add something in the space below “UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy? Ufologists Weigh In” so that there isn’t a big, wasted chunk of empty space on our page. We could perhaps input a photo or an animated GIF to take up the space.
